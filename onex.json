A bookmaker with a margin of less than 110% will offer competitive odds.</p><figure class='table'><table><tbody><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'><strong>Sports</strong></p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'><strong>Pre-match margin %</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'>Football</p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'>2.4-3%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'>Hockey</p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'>3.4-4.5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'>Tennis</p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'>5.5-6.5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'>Basketball</p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'>6-7%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style='text-align:center;'>MMA</p></td><td><p style='text-align:center;'>5-7%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 id='brand_anchor_7'>Average Margin</h3><p>When a bookmaker's margin is less than 110%, then it shows that they are not making so much profit from their players.
